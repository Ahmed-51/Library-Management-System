# Library-Management-System

**Minds** is an Online Library Management System website built in **ASP.NET** platform with ### **C#** as a programming language. It provides the users with the ability to **Register** to this website and **Search & Issue** books. Each user will have their **Own Account & User Profile** where their information and issued books will be shown. They can **Edit and Update their profile info** as needed.

Anyone can View book **without being a member** but to issue any book, they need to be registered member of the library. Once they find a book attractive they can apply for the book issuing and his interest in a particular book will be passed to the admin for approval with his user Id and book Id. If he is an active member of the library and not in Defaulters list, then the admin will approve his request and issue the book for a certain period of time if the book is available in the library.


## Database

A Centralized SQL database is maintained in for all users by an administrator so that it is accessible by every registered user. The database is controlled by admin so that database is Secured, Relevent and unnecessary information are not stored in the database. The admin can check every activities of the users. He can **see all information of any users, specify users Account Status and even Delete any users** if he finds anything inappropriate. He can see **Add, Update and Delete books as required**. He can Issue book to any users for a cetain period of time and also take back the book and automatically Stock Status gets updated in the database. If any user does not give back the book by defined time then he will be in the **Defaulters list** and his status will be changed accordingly.


The Website is made with **Visual Studio IDE, MS SQL Express 2017 database** which uses SQL Server Management Studio as a database and Chrome as a browser. In the process of buiding our websites, we have used **Bootstrap framework, Font awesome and Datatables Libraries** for customizing the webpages.
